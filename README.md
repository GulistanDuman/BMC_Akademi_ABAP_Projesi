# BMC Akademi ABAP Project  

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project  

This repository contains my ABAP training project developed during my internship at **BMC Otomotiv**.  
The project demonstrates various SAP ABAP concepts and best practices, including:  

- Modularized code with `INCLUDE` structures  
- Screen (Dynpro) design and navigation  
- Data handling and processing logic  
- Form routines for better code organization  

The source files are stored under the `src_report` folder:  

- `Z_BMCAKADEMI_TOP` â€“ Global data and type definitions  
- `Z_BMCAKADEMI_INPUT` â€“ User input handling  
- `Z_BMCAKADEMI_OUTPUT` â€“ Output display logic  
- `Z_BMCAKADEMI_PBO` â€“ Processing Before Output logic  
- `Z_BMCAKADEMI_FORM` â€“ Commonly used form routines  
- `Z_BMCAKADEMI_REPORT.ABAP` â€“ Main program entry point
